# TeXBlend - Compile Segments of LaTeX Documents

This tool compiles individual files that are included as parts of larger
documents. It utilizes the preamble of the main document but disregards all
other included files.

The main purpose is to allow fast compilation of particular chapters or
sections, eliminating the need to recompile the entire document. This
facilitates an efficient way to check for formatting or syntax errors in the
particular part of the document being worked on.
