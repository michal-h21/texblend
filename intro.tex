\section{Introduction}
This tool compiles individual files that are included as parts of larger documents. 
It utilizes the preamble of the main document but disregards all other included files.

The main purpose is to allow fast compilation of particular chapters or sections, 
eliminating the need to recompile the entire document.
This facilitates an efficient way to check for formatting or syntax errors in
the particular part of the document being worked on."
