hello world

\TeX4ht note about the \verb|--texoptions| command line option: you can use
this option to pass all command line arguments to \verb|make4ht|. You may need
to include the \verb|-| character in the place of filename for the correct
execution.

For example, if you want to use the \verb|fn-in| option, use the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
$ texblend  -H -O '- "fn-in"' sample.tex
\end{verbatim}

If you want to use for example a configuration file, use

\begin{verbatim}
$ texblend -l -H -O '-c config.cfg - "fn-in"' sample.tex
\end{verbatim}
